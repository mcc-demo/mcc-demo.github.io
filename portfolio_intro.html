	<h1>Sample Portfolio</h1>
	<p>Example portfolio created by the instructor of the course to show students
	what is possible if you choose to take the homework and make portfolio pieces.</p>
	<p>The Tools and Technologies for Technical Writers course includes a brief 
	introduction to HTML. While people today rarely hand-code HTML pages any more,
	since a large portion of published content is available on web sites today,
	and everything that appears on a web page is rendered as HTML, knowing the 
	rudimentary basics is worthwhile. This page is hand-coded HTML, which is often
	used for some index and other types of landing pages.</p>
	<p>Example classwork:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="WorkingWithMicrosoftWord.pdf">Working with Microsoft Word</a></dt>
		<dd>This is a PDF showing a rudimentary template that was originally crafted in Microsoft Word.</dd>
		<dt><a class="fakelink" onclick="pretendExample();">About the widget</a></dt>
		<dd>This is an example of conceptual content. It is aimed at a new user to introduce them to the Widget and what it does.</dd>
		<dt><a class="fakelink" onclick="pretendExample();">Configuring the widget</a></dt>
		<dd>This is an example of a procedure aimed at an administrator to configure a Widget. </dd>
		<dt><a class="fakelink" onclick="pretendExample();">getWidget</a></dt>
		<dd>This is a sample of the documentation of the REST API call getWidget. The <a class="fakelink" onclick="pretendExample();">source</a> of the content in swagger format is also available.</dd>
